# Bioinformatics 1
This project is written in C for a college course Bioinformatics 1.
It takes DNA sequence from a strain of E. Coli and samples it into k-mers of length 10, 20, 50, 100, 1000 and 10000.
All the sequences of length k are stored in a Dynamic Cuckoo Filter.


## To test the project:
1) Clone the project from the master branch
2) Run the following command in the project root

        bash startup.sh
